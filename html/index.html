        <h1>chat.starmaid.xyz</h1>

        <p>Welcome! You found the homepage for my matrix chat server. Likely you know me IRL or on the internet, and
          want to join a group chat that isn't on discord. Well you found the right place! Take a quick read here so you
          know what is going on.</p>

        <p>How to start chatting:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Pick a homeserver. This is the server that will host your account data and store your messages. I'm
            assuming you will be using this homeserver (chat.starmaid.xyz) but you can also
            pick one from <a href="https://servers.joinmatrix.org/">this list.</a></li>
          <li>If using chat.starmaid.xyz, go to the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/register">Official Element Web
              Client</a> to
            create your account.</li>
          <p><img src="guide_1.png" alt="" /></p>
          <p><img src="guide_2.png" alt="" /></p>
          <li>Enter the Registration Token. Message me and I will tell you. This prevents randos from creating accounts
            on this homeserver.</li>
          <p><img src="guide_3.png" alt="" /></p>
          <li>Pick a <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/">client program</a>. Element is great, so are some
            of the others.</li>
          <li>Send a message in the all-homeserver general chat! You should be auto-added after creating an account.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you want more information on any of these topics, check out the <a
            href="https://joinmatrix.org/guide/">Join Matrix Guide</a> for an in-depth look at whats going on here.</p>

        <p>Remember, this won't be Discord. Things are slightly different, there arent custom emojis. Things are a
          little rougher around the edges. I'm telling this to myself to remember to not get mad at the platform, and
          maybe we can help improve it.</p>

        <h2>Agreement</h2>

        <p>I will try to be a reasonable owner who maintains this server. Please be patient.</p>
        <p>Likewise, be cool and try not to abuse the server or others. If I never have to add more terms to this, then
          that will be awesome.</p>

        <h2>About the setup</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>I'm hosting this at my apartment on a desktop PC. Things that affect my apartment (internet/power outages,
            etc) will affect the server. I have a battery UPS, but I don't have two internet connections.</li>
          <li>I'm using Dynamic DNS from my ISP. This means sometimes Comcast will change the public IP of my apartment.
            My server will auto-update where starmaid.xyz points, But it may take a minute or so. This does not happen
            frequently - only once every several months. If I pay more, I could get a static IP 💭</li>
          <li>The server goes offline sometime between 4-5am PST on Mondays for maintenance/upgrades and stuff. Its
            usually only for a few minutes but could be longer.</li>
          <li>My backups are pretty manual right now. I'm working on improving it 💭, but theres always a non-zero
            chance I
            lose our chat data. IMO its better than using it for advertising or evil or whatever.</li>
          <li>I don't know what large voice call performance is like right now. We will test it, but may require some
            improvements in the future 💭</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Motivation</h2>

        <p>I'm doing this because I think its fun. I like setting up and configuring web services. I also like free open
          source software. I also like to do things for my friends. I actually tried this once before, <a
            href="https://www.nickymasso.com/blog/matrix-setup/">about 6 years ago</a>, and it was fun but not very
          performant. Since then, both matrix has improved (I'm using tuwunel instead of synapse) and people are losing
          patience with Discord.</p>

        <h2>What This Costs Me</h2>

        <p>These are all shared costs with everything else I do on my network, so its not like this is all-encompassing
          "WHAT I PAY FOR CHAT". But it gives an order of magnitude.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Domain (starmaid.xyz) costs $14/year</li>
          <li>Internet costs like $40 a month<sup class="sup-popup" id="elec-sup">1
              <div class="popup" id="popup-internet">Thanks xfinity.</div>
            </sup></li>
          <li>Electricity costs about $80 per year<sup class="sup-popup" id="elec-sup">2
              <div class="popup" id="popup-electricity">0.23 $/kWh × 40W × 0.001 kW/W × 24 h/day × 365 days/year ≈
                $80/year</div>
            </sup></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future</h2>

        <p>Realistically, if this server isn't enough and people want to pay for it, I can set this up on like a
          cloudflare server so it has better uptime and can scale to more users. We will make that call as we grow.</p>
